## Version 1.0 - Updates from legacy content

This release modularizes the legacy Intro to the CLI lecture and provides extensive updates to this content, as detailed below. Updates are provided here at the module level, but all subsequent updates should be documented at the lesson level.

### Release details

#### Additions

- Add a microlesson introducing the file system and how it works.
- Add definitions for terms throughout.
- Add instructions to launch a terminal application in Ubuntu and Windows.
- Add details on what a command is in the What is a Command? Level Up.
- Students now use the whoami command as their first command instead of `pwd`. `pwd` is still covered after they are introduced to the file system.

#### Changes

- Students are now introduced to the `rm` and `rmdir` commands in a You Do section.
- Expand on written lecture material to provide a more straightforward outline for instructors to deliver content with and to provide more thorough written documentation for students.
- Update content to be style guide compliant.
- Move flags content to Level Up material. Use the `ls` command to demonstrate flags instead of the `rm` command.
- Move getting help content to Level Up material.
- Move the shell content to Level Up material.
- Update the GA coding environment students create. Students will now have a `~/code/ga` directory, and inside that directory, they will have four other directories:
  - `lectures`
  - `labs`
  - `projects`
  - `sandbox`

  All lectures will use these directories for their setup.

#### Removals

- Remove the `cat` command.
- Remove the `rm -rf` command.
- Remove the `sudo` command.
- Remove cheat sheets.
- Remove many of the external resources provided.
- Remove lab intro.
