**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson students will be able to apply the four core principles of accessibility â€” perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

## The four principles of accessibility

The accommodations we've discussed help our content adhere to the [four main accessibility principles](https://www.boia.org/blog/what-are-the-four-major-categories-of-accessibility). These principles state that content should be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

### Perceivable

Information and user interface components must be presented so all users can perceive them. We do this through a few methods, namely:

- Provide text alternatives so that content can be made into text.
- Design for adaptability - our content should be able to be presented differently without losing any important information or structure.

### Operable

User interface components and controls must be operable by all users.

- Content should be keyboard accessible.
- Refrain from adding content that can trigger photosensitive conditions like epilepsy.
- Allow for different input modalities, such as touch.

### Understandable

Information and the operation of user interface components must be understandable. For example:

- Content should be readable and presented in a predictable way. Instructions should be clear and concise.
- Design our sites to assist users in inputting information so that they can avoid and correct mistakes when they enter information we weren't expecting.

### Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted reliably by users, including the assistive technologies they may use.

- We should design our website to be compatible with as many different browsers and assistive technologies as possible.
