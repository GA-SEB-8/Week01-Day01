### [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/)

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public collaborate to develop web standards. The W3C provides many resources on web accessibility, including the WAI resources mentioned below.

The W3C also provides several other resources on web development, such as tutorials, specifications, and tools. These resources can help us learn more about web development and creating accessible web applications.

### [Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/)

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is a part of the W3C that promotes web accessibility. The WAI provides a variety of resources, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are the most widely used accessibility standards.

The WAI also provides other resources, such as tutorials, checklists, and tools. These resources can help us to learn more about accessibility and how to make our software more accessible.

### [Lighthouse Accessibility checker for Chrome]((https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk))

Lighthouse is a free Chrome extension that scans web pages for potential accessibility problems. It can identify many issues, such as missing alt text, low color contrast, and inaccessible form fields.

To use Lighthouse, install the extension and click the icon in the Chrome toolbar. It will then scan the current web page for accessibility problems.

Lighthouse will display a report of any problems it finds, along with the severity of the problem and instructions on how to fix it. You can use Lighthouse to scan your own web pages or the web pages of other websites. It's a great tool for identifying and fixing accessibility problems.
