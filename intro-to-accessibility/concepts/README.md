**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to evaluate the role of accessibility in digital product design, recognizing its impact on social inclusion and the accommodation of various disabilities.

## What is accessibility?

Accessibility refers to the practice of ensuring that digital products and services are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It involves designing and developing products and services in a way that allows individuals of all backgrounds and capabilities to use them effectively.

To achieve accessibility, we aim to accommodate individuals with various disabilities, including those related to visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive functions.

## Why is it important?

Accessibility is important because it allows everyone to participate fully in society. When digital products and services are not accessible, they exclude people with disabilities. This can significantly impact their lives, preventing them from accessing education, employment, and essential services.

Whether you are aware of it or not, you've experienced the benefits of accessibility while using technology and digital products. Have you ever had to adjust your phone's brightness when using it in bright sunlight or used voice commands to perform tasks on your phone or smart device? You can thank accessibility for those innovations!

## Discussing disabilities

In crafting the content of these lessons, we've made thoughtful decisions grounded in inclusivity and clarity. We recognize our role as developers in ensuring the tools and platforms we create are accessible to all, without exception.

1. We speak of disabilities candidly, without resorting to euphemisms or condescension, because clear communication is the cornerstone of understanding and action. Our language strives to put people first, reflecting our focus on the individual rather than their disability, thereby promoting dignity and respect.
2. We are acutely aware that our audience is diverse and global, with varying preferences for how they are addressed or describe their experiences. While it is not feasible to cater to every individual preference in our broad communications, we strongly advocate for personal respect and adherence to one's chosen identifiers in one-on-one interactions. Asking and abiding by someone's preferences is not just a matter of politenessâ€”it's a fundamental acknowledgment of their identity and experience.

By committing to accessibility in our lessons, we serve not only those with permanent disabilities but also those facing temporary challenges or none at all. Accessible content transcends boundaries, ensuring that everyone has equal opportunity to learn, engage, and succeed irrespective of their current abilities.
